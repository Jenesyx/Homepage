Shortly after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the Islamic Regime of Iran imposed a mandatory hijab on women.

Mahsa's death resulted in large-scale protests across Iran, demanding justice for her, and fighting for women's basic human rights and freedom. 

The government of Iran is attempting to suppress the protests, shooting protesters, deploying tear gas and water cannons, and blocking access to the internet. So far, many people have been murdered, beaten, and have gotten arrested.

# What are protesters asking for?

The protestors are not protesting against Islam or any other religion, they are fighting for woman's basic rights:

* The right to choose how they dress
* The right to sing or dance
* The right to ask for a divorce, and to be considered to have custody over their children
* The right to leave their country without their husband's permission
* The right to go to the stadium

They are fighting for freedom of speech, not only for journalists but for all citizens.

They want their freedom back.
