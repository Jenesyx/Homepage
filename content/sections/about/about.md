Shortly after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the Islamic Regime of Iran imposed a mandatory hijab on women.

Mahsa's death resulted in large-scale protests across Iran, demanding justice for her, and fighting for women's basic human rights and freedom. 

The government of Iran is attempting to suppress the protests, shooting protesters, deploying tear gas and water cannons, and blocking access to the internet. So far, many people have been murdered, beaten, and have gotten arrested.
