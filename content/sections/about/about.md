On 16 September 2022, a 22-year-old Iranian woman named Mahsa Amini (Persian: مهسا امینی), also known as Jina Amini or
Zhina Amini (Persian: ژینا امینی, Kurdish: ژینا ئەمینی), died in Tehran, Iran, under suspicious circumstances,
allegedly due to police brutality.

The Guidance Patrol, the morality police of Iran's Law Enforcement Command, arrested Amini for not wearing the hijab in
accordance with government standards. Police said she had a heart attack at a station, fell on the floor, and died after
two days in a coma. Eyewitnesses and women who were detained with Amini said she was severely beaten, which in
addition to her leaked medical scans, led independent observers to diagnose cerebral hemorrhage and stroke.
